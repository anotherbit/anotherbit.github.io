description: As avid fans of these fantastic games, we wanted to create a utility that simplified and sped-up game setup; in particular role assignment and revealed information to each player. <i><b>You must own a physical copy of at least one of these games in order to take advantage of this app</b></i>.  This app automates the assignment of roles and information to each player without having to use the setup script--no closing of eyes, no sticking thumbs up, etc.  With hundreds of games played, we've also come up with some incredibly fun fan made roles and "tactics" that add even more enjoyment to these terrific games.  Have fun!
